1. REMARKS ON Zenger's TRYAL. Taken out of the Barbados GAZETTE'S; for the Benefit of the Students in Law, and others in North-AmericaN. B. Theſe Remarks are annexed to Zenger's Tryal publiſhed in the 9th Volume of State Tryals, and at the End of the Title, refers to the following Notes, (viz.)Theſe Remarks were written by two eminent Lawyers in one of our Colonies in America, immediately after the Publication of the Trial of Mr. Zenger, which it ſeems had been induſtriouſly ſpread over that Part of the World, before it reached England!As the Doctrines contained in that Tryal, or rather in the Speech of Mr. Hamilton, are of ſo new a Caſt, and ſo abſolutely contradictory to all the Reſolutions, and Judgments, that have been ſettled and eſtabliſhed for ſo many Ages, and by Judges of the higheſt Reputation, and moſt unqueſtionable Characters for their Integrity, Virtues, and Abilities; it could not be imagined, ſo wild, and idle an Harangue, could have had any Weight, or have met with 〈◊〉 Reception here (i. e. in England) where the Laws, relating to Libels, have been ſo often canvaſſed, and are generally ſo well underſtood; and therefore the Perſon, to whom theſe Remarks were ſent, never thought of making any other Uſe of them, than to ſatisfy his own Curioſity, and that of his Friends.But ſeeing to his great Surpriſe, that this extraordinary Declamation, has been mentioned with 〈◊〉 Air of Applauſe, and Triumph, in ſeveral News-Papers, as ſtriking out ſome new Lights, with Regard to the Doctrine of Libels, and upon the Credit of that Recommendation, the whole Tryal not only twice printed here, but retailed out in Scraps, in the public News-Papers; whereby many well meaning People may be deceived, and led into wrong Notions, concerning the Laws of their Country in this Point: He has thought fit to communicate theſe Remarks to the public, in order to remove any Miſtake, or Errors, that Perſons may fall into, for want of an adequate Judgment in theſe Matters; and the rather, becauſe if ſuch falſe Opinions, ſhould happen to influence the Conduct of Practiſe of any, the Conſequences may be very dangerous; it being an eſtabliſhed Maxim in our Law, that neither Ignorance, nor Miſtake, is an Excuſe to any one who has broke it, from the Penalty of it. PART I.
Mr. Keimer,IT has been a common Remark among thoſe who have obſerved upon the capricious Diſpenſatio
